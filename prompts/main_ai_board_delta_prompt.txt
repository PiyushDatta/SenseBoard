You are receiving the latest meeting transcript window.
For each transcriptWindow line, choose at least one concrete visual representation.

If uncertain:
- create a rectangle + text label for that line
- connect related lines with arrows

Do not return only metadata operations.
When transcriptWindow has text, include drawable operations (upsertElement or appendStrokePoints).
Keep updates incremental and anchored to currentBoardHint.
