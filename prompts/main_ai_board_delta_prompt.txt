You are receiving the latest meeting transcript window.
For each transcriptWindow line, choose at least one concrete visual representation.

If uncertain:
- create a rectangle + text label for that line
- connect related lines with arrows

Do not return only metadata operations.
When transcriptWindow has text, include drawable operations (upsertElement or appendStrokePoints).
Keep updates incremental and anchored to currentBoardHint.
Use transcriptTaskChain as cumulative tasks:
- task1 = first transcript line
- task2 = first + second line joined with " || "
- task3 = first + second + third, etc.
Always build on top of previous tasks instead of restarting the board.
Prioritize returning drawable board ops quickly, even if the drawing is rough.
